# Beijing-Inn-Website
Beijing Inn's Official Website

> The official website for Gillingham's best Chinese restaurant!

> Recently modernised to move away from **000webhost** and introduced good practice. It is now served via **Github Pages**

# Features
PHP now removed. Uses pure **HTML5** + **JS** + **CSS**.

Using CDNs instead of storing 3rd party libraries in source control.

Removed archived website from master branch. Seperate `000webhost` branch contains the old legacy website.

Using **FontAwesome** to serve the footer icons.

Huge speed increase from using the old hosted solution.
